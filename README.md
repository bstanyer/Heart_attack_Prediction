# Heart_attack_Prediction
Predicting heart attack risk using machine learning models on medical data.

This project developed machine learning models to predict the risk of heart attacks using a dataset of patient medical information. The dataset included 14 key health attributes such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate, all known to be indicators of cardiovascular health. The goal was to create machine learning models that could effectively identify individuals at higher risk for heart attacks, aiding in preventative care. By applying various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and others, the most significant factors correlated with heart attack risk were assessed.

The results indicated that the KNN model performed the best, achieving an accuracy of over 80%. This model's interpretability made it a suitable choice for healthcare applications, where understanding key risk factors is essential. The analysis showed that chest pain type and maximum heart rate were effective predictors of hearrt attack risk. While these results are promising, further tuning of the models, combined with the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), would improve performance and provide deeper insights into the data. Expanding the dataset could also help validate these findings and enhance the generalizability of the models.
